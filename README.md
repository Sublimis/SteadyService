## About the service

This service uses the [AccessibilityService API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accessibilityservice/AccessibilityService) to retrieve interactive windows on the screen, in order to find compatible ones. It then sends multiple "move window" accessibility actions to such windows, as needed, to perform the intended function. The service never collects, stores nor shares any data that can be of personal and confidential nature in any way.

‚ö° The service has been crafted very meticulously, in order to minimize resource usage and maximize performance.
